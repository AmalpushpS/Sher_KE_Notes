ğŸ”¹ Layer 7 â€“ Application:  
Interfaces directly with user applications, enabling them to send/receive data over a network.

ğŸ”¹ Layer 6 â€“ Presentation:  
Translates data between application and network formats; handles encryption, compression, and formatting.

ğŸ”¹ Layer 5 â€“ Session:  
Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between devices, ensuring data streams stay distinct.

ğŸ”¹ Layer 4 â€“ Transport:  
Manages end-to-end delivery of data using protocols like TCP (reliable) or UDP (fast). Splits data into segments/datagrams.

ğŸ”¹ Layer 3 â€“ Network:  
Handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and routes data across networks to its destination.

ğŸ”¹ Layer 2 â€“ Data Link:  
Adds physical (MAC) addressing, formats data for transmission, and performs error checking on received data.

ğŸ”¹ Layer 1 â€“ Physical:  
Deals with actual hardware transmissionâ€”sending and receiving raw binary data as electrical or optical signals.
