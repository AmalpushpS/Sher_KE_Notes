## `ln` 
---
```bash
# Solid symbolic link:
ln -s /path/to/target/user/.local/share/backgrounds /path/file


# Second command of ln command
....
```

####### - What symbolic links actually is, they create a link for your targeted file or directory. For example, If I created a symbolic link for `/home/user/.local/share/backgrounds/` into the `/here`. now what we can do is, when I'll do `cd /here` then I'll directory move into the `/home/user/.local/share/backgrounds/`.

```The command  creates a **new, unique, temporary directory** with a random name.
